Project Overview: Simple Chatbot
This project is a state-based chatbot that interacts with users through a structured conversation flow. The chatbot can ask and respond to various topics, including hobbies, travel, cooking, movies, music, sports, and books. It maintains conversation continuity by remembering the user's previous answers and guiding them through different topics.

Technologies Used:
Python: For implementing chatbot logic.
Conditional Statements: To determine responses based on user input.
Loops: To keep the conversation running until the user exits.
Features:
✅ Personalized Interaction – The chatbot asks for the user's name and hobbies, making the conversation engaging.
✅ State-Based Responses – It remembers past responses and progresses through different topics.
✅ Error Handling – If the user enters an unrecognized response, it prompts them to rephrase.
✅ Exit Option – The conversation can be ended by saying "bye" or "goodbye."

How to Run the Project:
Download the script and open it in a Python environment.
Run the script, and the chatbot will start interacting with the user.
The conversation will continue based on user inputs until they type "bye" to exit.
